    At the end of the experiment, one round will be chosen at
        random of the 25 rounds to determine your earnings for the experiment.
        Each round is equally likely to be chosen.
        Your earnings Part 1 will be determined by the
        result of the decision round chosen.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because you will not know in advance which round will be chosen,
        you should treat each round as if it is the one which will determine your earnings.
    </p>

    <p>
    A number from 1 to 100 will also be randomly drawn to determine
        the outcome of your chosen option, each number from 1 to 100
        is equally likely to be drawn.
