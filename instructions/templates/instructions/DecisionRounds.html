Part 1: A typical decision round

    <p>
    In each decision round, you will see two options, as in the example below:
    <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static "instructions/lottery_p26.jpg" %}"/>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static "instructions/lottery_q26.jpg" %}"/>
    </p>

    {% if session.config.show_expected and session.config.show_risk %}
    <p>
    To the right of the horizontal bar showing the amounts you would earn
        for each possible draw are two columns.
        The first column is labelled Average Returns.
        You can think of this as the amount you would earn
        if we were to do a large number of random draws,
        and compute the average earnings per draw.
        Remember however that your earnings from the option
        you choose will be determined by a single draw only.

        The second column is labelled Risk.
        This shows the standard deviation, which is a measure
        of how spread out the earnings are.  The earnings from
        an option with a higher standard deviation are more variable
        than the earnings from an option with a lower standard deviation.
